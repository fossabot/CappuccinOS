## Setup
Before building CappuccinOS, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- rust
- binutils
- xorriso
- qemu (optional)

Clone the repo:
```BASH
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/juls0730/CappuccinOS.git
cd CappuccinOS
```

Install rust, and switch to the nightly build:
```BASH
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y --default-toolchain none
rustup override set nightly
```

## Usage
Build the image to `bin/CappuccinOS.iso`:
```BASH
make build
```

Run CappuccinOS with QEMU:
```BASH
make run
```

Run on a bare metal machine by flashing to a USB stick or hard drive:
```
sudo dd if=bin/CappuccinOS.iso of=/dev/sdX && sync
```
**Be careful not to overwrite your hard drive when using `dd`!**
